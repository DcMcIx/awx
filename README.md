## Deployment

To deploy AWX make sure you have ansible installed and your inventory populated with the target server :

Playbook execution:

```
You can target your server by adding '--limit' flag :
```bash
ansible-playbook AWX_Deploy_On_Single_Node_K3S.yml --limit [SERVER_IP_OR_SERVER_NAME]
```

```

## Uninstall AWX-Operator

To UNdeploy AWX :

```bash
ansible-playbook AWX_UNDEPLOY_Single_Node_K3S.yml

## FAQ

#### No access to GUI after deployment :

You must wait a few minutes before having all the pods and services started, depending on your hardware configuration
```
Example: 2vCPU and 4Gi of memory you will need to wait up to 15 minutes to get all started
```
#### How To access AWX GUI :

During the deployment process NodePort is displayed througt the play log

http://{{SERVER_IP}}:{{NODEPORT}}

#### How to get NodePort after the deployment
On the AWX-Operator Server :
```
kubectl config set-context --current --namespace=awx
kubectl describe svc awx-service | grep -i NodePort | grep -v Type
```
#### How To retreive the GUI password :
```
kubectl config set-context --current --namespace=awx
kubectl get secret awx-admin-password -o jsonpath="{.data.password}" | base64 --decode
```
#### Is the server exposed to the network/internet :
Yes, once the AWX-Operator is installed the server will be reachable from the same local network area

And NO, the server won't be exposed to the internet unless you do so by exposing the IP/NodePort

#### Is this deployment suitable for a "Production" environment :
Note that no support is provided for this deployment (this is a personal project that I wanted to share based on the original awx/awx-operator project). If you need a reliable production environment with support, please consider looking at :
